    <h1>Austin Housing Affordability</h1>
    <h3>Project Proposal/Outline</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Austin has become one of the fastest growing cities in the country, and is expected to grow significantly in the next years. In addition, it is common knowledge the housing prices in Austin are becoming increasingly more expensive.</p>
        <p>Our project is to uncover patterns of housing affordability in Austin, Texas. We'll examine relationships between property values over time, changing demographics/population growth, and income trends across races and genders over time.</p>
